== Demo

video::yNaiQO94_sQ[youtube]

Demo is outdated, the UI is much more polished now

== Security

Consider it dangerous and harmful for now. You can try to use it, still.

== Performance

None. The protocol is awful for now, do not expect it to transfer large amounts of data quickly.

== Plans

TODO: Switch to popups, once https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1799344 lands
TODO: Use popups when available
TODO: Settings
TODO: Security

== License

Not decided yet, code is not yet completed. For now consider this code source-available, and do not try to use it.
